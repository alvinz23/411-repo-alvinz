#Snicker sync part, formal requirements 

#Goal and non-goal requirements 
Goal - Allow users to sync their merges with humorous feedback in the form of meme sounds (snickering) 
to make the merging process more enjoyable.

Non-goal - The tool will not inherently handle or resolve merge conflicts by itself, 
it will only provide meme-based feedback during the syncing process.

#Non-functional/functional requirements 

#non-functional 1
Efficiency - Snickersync should provide meme-based feedback quickly and do so without lagging or slowing down 
or hindering the process of merging. 

#non-functional 2 
Access control -  Only authorized users should be able to access and configure the SnickerSync settings to
make sure that only certain people can manage the snickering options.


#four functional requirements
Functional Requirement 1: Implement role-based authentication to restrict access to SnickerSync settings,
 allowing only developers and PMs to view and modify configurations.


Functional Requirement 2: Maintain an access log that tracks every change made to SnickerSync settings, 
recording the user, action taken, and timestamp for auditing purposes.


Functional Requirement 3: Implement a progress bar that shows the percentage of completion during the sync process 
with even more memes displaying and sound effects as it loads. 

Functional Requirement 4: The merging happens, and at the same time, the memes are displayed without causing
 any delay or lag in the merging process.
