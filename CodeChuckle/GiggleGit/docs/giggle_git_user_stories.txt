User Stories: 
1. As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to easily navigate and understand the interface,
and use the features of GiggleGit without having to read a bunch of documentation and watching tutorials.

2. As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want a easy onboarding process with clear steps and instructions
so that my members can be efficiently trained and can start using GiggleGit withoutb having to spend a lot of time learning it.

3. As a user, I want to customize the types of memes shown during my time using GiggleGit
 I want to be able to tailor GiggleGit to my style of humor. 
 Associated ticket 1:
 - Create meme category options :  Design a set of meme categories and allow users to select their
  preferences in the settings and implement the proper front end to support this functionality.
 - Develop Logic for Meme Selection : Implement backend functionality to ensure that selected meme categories 
 are shown to users during their GiggleGit interactions and that their choices are accurately represented in the program.

4. This statement is not a user story since the statement lacks a reason for why the user wants this feature and what their
 ultimate goal is with that feature, a user story should explain why the user wants this
 functionality to demonstrate the value. 
 A better user story might be: As a user, I want to authenticate my account on new devices so I can 
 continue to work on my projects wherever I want and access the same style of memes I have across all devices.
